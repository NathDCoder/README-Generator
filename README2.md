This is my attempt at the Readme Generator. I actually really enjoyed this project
and was able to get most if not all of the requirements to work.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. I first downloaded all of the necesarry components such as Inquirer and FS. 

2. I then created the prompts for the questions and then I created a .then function to 
acquire the data from the .generatemardown file. After I wrote an fs.writefile function to generate the Readme file. 

3. After I wrote a function in the markdown file so that when the Readme is generated it would have all of the corresponding headings.

4. Lastly, I created a function to display the license and also within that function if a user were to choose none to stop the code.
